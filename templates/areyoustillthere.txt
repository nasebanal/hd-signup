Hi {{ first_name }},

We miss you!  According to our records, you signed up as a member of Hacker Dojo, but your membership has since lapsed.  We realize that some people might not have realized this happened, so we hope you don't mind this automated e-mail to double check if this was intentional.

This e-mail will continue once a week until you choose one of two paths: (aggressive -- sorry!)

Please note that all your current events have been put on hold until you
reactivate your membership, and will expire 72 days after your membership
lapsed.

(1) Enter your credit card to get your membership active again: (only takes 1-2 minutes)
{{ subscribe_url }}

(2) If you don't wish to be a member again, please unsubscribe so we stop mailing you:

If you need billing help, please contact treasurer@hackerdojo.com.

Cheers,
Hacker Dojo
