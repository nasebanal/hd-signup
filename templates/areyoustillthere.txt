Hi {{ first_name }},

We miss you!  According to our records, you signed up as a member of Hacker Dojo, but your membership has since lapsed.  We realize that some people might not have realized this happened, so we hope you don't mind this automated e-mail to double check if this was intentional.

This e-mail will continue once a week until you choose one of two paths: (aggressive -- sorry!)

(1) Enter your credit card to get your membership active again: (only takes 1-2 minutes)
{{ subscribe_url }}

(2) If you don't wish to be a member again, please unsubscribe so we stop mailing you:
{{ unsubscribe_url }}

If you need billing help, please contact treasurer@hackerdojo.com.

Cheers,
Hacker Dojo
